# quick-woo-fetch
 Quick Woo Fetch is a streamlined WordPress plugin that enables the rapid extraction of WooCommerce products directly from the database. It bypasses the conventional WooCommerce API, resulting in faster data retrieval. The plugin exposes a REST API endpoint for fetching the products and returns the products as JSON objects with id and sku properties.
